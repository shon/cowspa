MooEditable Localization
========================

The file Locale.en-US.MooEditable.example.js is an example locale file as reference for non US English translators. Do not use this file.

By default, MooEditable is localized to US English, without dependency on [Locale](http://mootools.net/docs/more/Locale/Locale). Locale is only required when using the localization files to add additional languages.
